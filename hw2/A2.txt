Assignment 2

Questions:
1. To find a winner of NIM, we must find who will be unable to balance the piles. By this, I mean that 
	we change them to binary to make sure that they are all in the same format. Once this is done, we
	do XOR on them to see what is unbalanced about all of the piles. If it is possible to balance the piles
	from the current point, then the first player can keep reactively balancing after player 2 unbalances them.
	If not, player 2 will be the one to balance them. 

	For a game like NIM, there are a limited amount of moves. One must leave room to react to the opponent. The 
	only way to guarantee this, is to make sure that the XOR is always 0 after your move. In this way,
	whatever the other player does, the binary structures can be rebalanced if done correctly.

2. For NIM poker if there is a current winning scenario after your move, all you would have to do is remove the 
	amount of stones your opponent adds on in order to keep the board balanced. If you are not in a winning
	position on your turn, then just like in NIM, you are screwed against a competent opponent.
